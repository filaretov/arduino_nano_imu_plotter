# Arduino Nano IMU

Read IMU values from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and plot them in a terminal. Built with tui-rs.

The code on the Arduino itself is written in C++ (for now).


![Three plots of data streamed from an IMU, stacked vertically. The top one plots acceleration measured in g-force. The middle one plots angular velocity measured in degrees per second. The bottom one plots the magnetic field measured in micro Tesla (although the correct unit is Gauss). In each plot, each axis is colored differently.](tuirs-imu.png)
